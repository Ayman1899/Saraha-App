What is Saraha?
Saraha is an anonymous messaging web application built with Node.js and Express. The platform enables users to:

Create accounts with email verification
Receive anonymous messages from others without revealing sender identity
Send anonymous messages to registered users
Manage their profile including personal information and account settings
The application implements a complete authentication system with JWT-based sessions, email confirmation workflows, and role-based access control. All sensitive data is protected through bcrypt password hashing and AES encryption for personally identifiable information.
